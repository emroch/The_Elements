The_Elements
============

Fun fact reference source for the 92 natural elements of the periodic table.

Developed initially as a term project for a high school chemistry class, this project has grown to encompass all 92 natural elements. This in by no means a scientific reference source, but instead is intended as a fun way to engage non chemists in the amazing world of chemicals.

This is writen in java, with heavy reliance on the <a href="http://www.processing.org">processing</a> library functions, such as the <a href="http://processing.org/reference/PImage.html">PImage class</a> and graphic output functions.
